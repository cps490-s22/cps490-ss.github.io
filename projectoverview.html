  <h1 class="text-center text-white"> BFA Wind Explorer Project Overview</h1>
  <h4 class="text-primary"><u>Project Context and Scope: </h4></u>
    <p class="text-center text-white">The Wind Explorer Android and IOS application is a React JS based phone application commissioned 
        by the Balloon Federation of America (BFA). The application will allow users to replace the need 
        for GPS devices traditionally placed in pilot balloons in order to gather important weather data 
        for the proper operation of their balloons. The app will allow users to simply press a button and 
        track the rising pilot balloon with their mobile device to gather this data, rather than risk losing an expensive 
        GPS unit. The intention is for the app to be available for members of the BFA.</p>
    <h5 class="text-danger"> The main functional requirement that we are trying to achieve is to:  </h5>  
    <ul> 
        <li class="text-white">Design and develop an iOS and Android application for the Balloon Federation of America that
            allows individuals to calculate, display, and record wind data and pibal position. </li>
    </ul>

    
<br>
        <h4 class="text-primary"><u>Design Requirements: </h4></u>
        <ul class="user-requirements"> 
        <ul class="text-white"> 
            <li> Utilize phone on-board sensors in Portrait, Landscape, and Sideways orientations</li>
            <ul>
                <li> Application must produce identical readings for each orientation</li>
                <li>Functionality and features identical to previous version of Android Wind Explorer
                    application</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Wind data calculations identical to previous version of Android Wind Explorer
                application</li>
            <li>Aesthetics identical (to greatest extent possible) to the previous version of Android Wind
                    Explorer application</li>
            <li>Data output/storage identical (format, file types, storage location) to the previous version
                    of Android Wind Explorer application</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Live post CSV information during in-progress wind reading to user-designated,
                    personal Google Sheets account</li>
                <li>Generate output file (CSV, XML, and JPEG formats) and upload files to user-
                    designated, personal Google Drive account </li>
                <li>Save generated output files (CSV, XML, and JPEG formats) locally on the phone
                    to a user-designated folder for the user to access later</li>

             </ul>
             <li>User will have the ability to select a CSV file from a previous wind reading to re-display
                the output within the Wind Explorer app (data table, hodograph)</li>
            <li>User will have the ability to select output in Above Ground Level (AGL) or Mean Sea
                Level (MSL)</li>
            <li> User will have the ability to select using GPS altitude for MSL reference or a fixed
                reference altitude.</li>
            <li>User will have the ability to select height rounding interval</li>
            <li>Pre-set or user entered Rate of Climb (ROC) coefficient for Pibal</li>
            <li>User will have the ability to select azimuth reference, True north, Magnetic north, Grid
                north or User offset</li>
            <li>User will have the ability to select speed reference, KPH, MPH, or Knots</li>
            <li>User will have the ability to select rate of climb units or feet per minute, feet per second,
                meters per second, or other units as found in the current Android app.</li>
            <li>User will have the ability to select using the phones compass sensor for all azimuth data,
                or use the phone compass sensor for the first reading and all subsequent reading are
                relative to the first by using the phones gyro sensors.</li>
            <li>User will have the ability to capture ‘North’ direction with a user button input to zero the
                azimuth reference and all readings will subsequently be based on the gyro sensors.</li>
            <li>User have the ability to select height units in feet or meters</li>
            <li>The initial data point as a reference for the first reading shall be displayed on the data
                table as “Surface” and display the azimuth at the time the data point was captured; speed
                does not need to be calculated or displayed for this measurement</li>
            <li>All output timestamps to utilize Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) versus the local time
                from the phone</li>
            <li>Pre-populated file names when saving files generated from the app shall be based on the
                start date/time (in UTC) of the wind reading, in the following format:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_UTC.[file extension]</li>
                <li>Example: 20200916_133427_UTC.csv</li>

            <li>Testing required to verify any requirements</li>
            <li>Balloon Federation of America (BFA) server authentication for active BFA members
                (requires coordination with BFA server administrator)</li>
            <ul>

            <li>The application must allow for updates in the future. The platform used to code the
                algorithms should allow for future maintenance including migration to future IOS and
                Android operating system versions.</li>
            <li>Results rounding based on client specifications</li>
